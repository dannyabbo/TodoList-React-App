# Todo List App using ReactJS


## Overview

This is a Simple Todo List App that I've developed using ReactJS. It's designed to showcase the core concepts of React while offering a practical implementation of a todo list.

## Features

- **Create Todo:** You can easily add new tasks to your list by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. The new task will appear in the list.

- **Edit Todo:** To edit a task, simply click on it. The task text will become editable, allowing you to make changes. Press Enter to save the edited task.

- **Delete Todo:** Each task has a delete button (trash icon) associated with it. Clicking this button will remove the task from the list.

## Getting Started

To explore the app and its functionality:

 - Clone the repo, CD into the directory and use NPM start to run the App.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** The app is built using ReactJS, highlighting the fundamental concepts of React.
- **CSS:** Minimal styling has been applied to keep the focus on functionality.

## Future Possibilities

While this app demonstrates basic functionality, there are several avenues for improvement:

- **Local Storage:** Implement local storage to persist tasks even after the browser is closed.
- **Priority Levels:** Add the ability to set task priority levels.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Incorporate options for filtering and sorting tasks.
- **User Authentication:** Introduce user accounts and authentication for personalization.
